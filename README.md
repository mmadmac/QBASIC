# QBASIC

This folder is for saving my QBASIC programs. 
I still love QBASIC, and I'm currently using QB64.
In my opinion, QB64 is a distraction-free programming enviroment.

Islas.bas is a map generator, it creates islands with a start and a finish path.
Primv2.bas is another map generator, in this case a labyrinth generator based on Prim's algorithm.

If you get the output of these, you can draw a map with graphics.
